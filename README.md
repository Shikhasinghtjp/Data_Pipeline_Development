This repository contains a simple and modular **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline script built with Python.
The script reads a CSV file, processes it using standard imputation, encoding, and scaling techniques, and outputs clean data ready for machine learning or analysis.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Reads data from CSV
- Drops unnecessary columns
- Imputes missing values
- Encodes categorical features
- Scales numerical data
- Uses scikit-learn pipelines for clean transformations

🔧 Main Functions

extract_data(): Loads and cleans the dataset.

build_pipeline(): Builds preprocessing steps.

run_pipeline(): Applies transformation and outputs processed data.
